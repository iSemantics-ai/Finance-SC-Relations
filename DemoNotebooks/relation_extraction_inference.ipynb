Agreements with FSL include agreements for the supply of product wafer foundry services, sort services and assembly and test services relating to the microcontroller and analog businesses. These agreements are at competitive market rates and enable us to leverage FSL's existing manufacturing capabilities and relationships with its partners spanning across various technologies, processes, geometries and wafer sizes in their wafer fabrication facilities and package solutions in their back end manufacturing facilities, until such time that we can either move these internally to our fabrication and back end facilities or find alternative solutions. For FSL, the fabrication facilities are all located in Japan, while the back end facilities are in Japan and other Asian countries. The supply agreements do not call for any minimum purchase commitments. The arrangement with XMC provides production support for advanced NOR technology products at 65, 45 and development of 32 nanometers. The arrangement with SK Hynix provides for the development and supply of SLC NAND products at the 4x and 3x nodes.   \n",
